## Criterion Breakdown

### Development Progress

- **Level:** Complete System — **Points:** 35

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has demonstrated a commendable effort in implementing the Week 2 deliverable. The presence of atomic commits indicates a thoughtful approach to version control, and the pipeline is complete with all necessary components, including detectives, judges, and the Chief Justice. Furthermore, all required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. While there may be room for improvement in the judicial layer, ...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The evidence indicates that there is a partial implementation of the Week 2 deliverable. While there are atomic commits and a full pipeline structure is present, the evidence suggests that there may be some gaps in the judicial layer and the completeness of the audit report. The presence of only one commit raises concerns about the iterative development process, which is essential for a robust engineering practice. Therefore, while the core infrastructure and detective layer are in place, the la...
- **TechLead** (score 4): The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of distinct judicial personas and a Chief Justice layer. However, the evidence suggests that there may be room for improvement in the iterative n...

**Remediation:** The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of distinct judicial personas and a Chief Justice layer. However, the evidence suggests that there may be room for improvement in the iterative nature of commits, as only one commit was noted, which could indicate a lack of incremental development. Overall, the quality of engineering and completeness of the deliverable is high, warranting a score of 4.

### Feedback Implementation

- **Level:** No Exchange — **Points:** 0
- **Excluded from total.**

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): There is no evidence of any feedback exchange, as the audit report indicates that no feedback file or directory was found in the repository. Without any feedback being provided or received, it is appropriate to score this criterion as No Exchange.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): There is no evidence of any feedback being exchanged or acted upon, as indicated by the absence of a feedback file or directory in the repo. This lack of documentation suggests a complete failure to engage with the feedback process, warranting a score of No Exchange.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of any feedback exchange, as the audit report indicates that no feedback file or directory was found in the repository. This lack of documentation suggests that the peer did not receive or act on any feedback, leading to a score of No Exchange.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of any feedback exchange, as the audit report indicates that no feedback file or directory was found in the repository. This lack of documentation suggests that the peer did not receive or act on any feedback, leading to a score of No Exchange.

### Proactive Communication

- **Level:** Absent — **Points:** 0

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): The evidence indicates a complete absence of proactive communication. There are no records of the peer initiating any updates, sharing progress, or flagging blockers. Without any engagement or communication, it is clear that the peer did not fulfill the expectations for proactive communication as outlined in the success pattern. Therefore, a score of 1 is warranted as there is no evidence of any effort or intent to communicate proactively.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication regarding progress, blockers, or design decisions. The absence of any collected evidence indicates a complete lack of engagement or initiative in making the feedback loop functional. This suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not initiate any communication, which aligns with the failure pattern of being absent.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The absence of any documented progress updates, blocker flags, or design discussions indicates a lack of engagement and initiative. The peer did not initiate any communication or share the repository for feedback, making them unreachable and unresponsive.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The absence of any documented progress updates, blocker flags, or design discussions indicates a lack of engagement and initiative. The peer did not initiate any communication or share the repository for feedback, making them unreachable and unresponsive.

### Agent Feedback Relevance

- **Level:** Full Forensic Audit — **Points:** 25

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specified requirements. It provided structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-references, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository. The feedback was actionable and relevant, with a synthesized verdict that included criterion scores and remediation suggestions. This indicates a high level of effort and intent to deliver quality feedback, even if there may be minor areas for improvement...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The auditor agent produced a targeted analysis that references actual files and structures, indicating a level of engagement with the peer repository. However, the evidence lacks depth in certain areas, such as the absence of a thorough judicial synthesis and the potential for missing checks. While the audit report is grounded in the repository's context, it does not fully meet the criteria for a complete forensic audit due to these limitations.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete forensic audit report that adhered to the specifications. It provided structured evidence through git analysis, AST, file analysis, and cross-references. The feedback was actionable and relevant, with a synthesized verdict that included criterion scores and remediation suggestions. This indicates a high level of performance, though there may be minor areas for improvement in depth and synthesis.

## Remediation Plan

**Development Progress**: The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of distinct judicial personas and a Chief Justice layer. However, the evidence suggests that there may be room for improvement in the iterative nature of commits, as only one commit was noted, which could indicate a lack of incremental development. Overall, the quality of engineering and completeness of the deliverable is high, warranting a score of 4.

**Feedback Implementation**: There is no evidence of any feedback exchange, as the audit report indicates that no feedback file or directory was found in the repository. This lack of documentation suggests that the peer did not receive or act on any feedback, leading to a score of No Exchange.

**Proactive Communication**: There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The absence of any documented progress updates, blocker flags, or design discussions indicates a lack of engagement and initiative. The peer did not initiate any communication or share the repository for feedback, making them unreachable and unresponsive.
