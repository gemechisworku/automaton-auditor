## Criterion Breakdown

### Development Progress

- **Level:** Complete System — **Points:** 35

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has demonstrated significant effort and intent in their development progress. They have made atomic commits and established a full pipeline that includes all necessary components such as detectives, judges, and the Chief Justice. The presence of all required files and the successful execution against a peer repository further indicate a strong understanding of the project requirements. While there may be areas for improvement, the overall completeness and quality of the engineering proc...
- **Prosecutor** (score 4): The evidence indicates a complete system with atomic meaningful commits, a full pipeline that includes detectives, judges, and a Chief Justice, along with all required files present and substantive. The system has been run against a peer repo with a real report, demonstrating thorough implementation and adherence to the success pattern. The presence of a complete graph structure and the audit directory further supports this assessment.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits, a fully functional pipeline, and all required files present and substantive. The system has been run against a peer repository, yielding a real report, which indicates a high level of completeness and quality in the engineering process. The presence of a full graph with parallel processing, distinct judges, and a Chief Justice layer further supports this assessment.

**Remediation:** The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits, a fully functional pipeline, and all required files present and substantive. The system has been run against a peer repository, yielding a real report, which indicates a high level of completeness and quality in the engineering process. The presence of a full graph with parallel processing, distinct judges, and a Chief Justice layer further supports this assessment.

### Feedback Implementation

- **Level:** Selective — **Points:** 12

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has effectively acted on the feedback received, as evidenced by traceable commits that address substantive feedback. There is clear documentation of deferrals and the implementation of agent findings that have led to architectural improvements. The effort to integrate feedback into the development process demonstrates a strong understanding of the intent behind the feedback, even if not every piece of feedback was fully addressed. This indicates a commitment to improvement and a proacti...
- **Prosecutor** (score 2): The evidence indicates that feedback was provided, but there is no traceable response in the repository showing that the peer acted on this feedback. The audit report mentions peer feedback files, but it does not confirm any commits or changes made in response to that feedback. This lack of acknowledgment or action on the feedback suggests that it was largely ignored, leading to a score of 2.
- **TechLead** (score 3): The peer has addressed some feedback with traceable commits, indicating a selective response to the provided input. However, not all deeper feedback was addressed, and there is no comprehensive documentation of deferrals or architectural improvements driven by agent findings. This suggests a lack of full integration of feedback into the development process, resulting in a score of 3.

**Remediation:** The peer has addressed some feedback with traceable commits, indicating a selective response to the provided input. However, not all deeper feedback was addressed, and there is no comprehensive documentation of deferrals or architectural improvements driven by agent findings. This suggests a lack of full integration of feedback into the development process, resulting in a score of 3.

### Proactive Communication

- **Level:** Absent — **Points:** 0

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): The evidence indicates a complete absence of proactive communication. There are no records of the peer initiating any updates, sharing progress, or flagging blockers. The lack of engagement and responsiveness suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not contribute to a functional feedback loop. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate as there is no evidence of any communication efforts.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication regarding progress, blockers, or design decisions. The absence of any collected evidence indicates a complete lack of engagement or initiative in communication, which aligns with the failure pattern of being unreachable and not initiating any updates.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The absence of any documented progress updates, blocker flags, or design discussions indicates a lack of engagement and initiative. The peer did not initiate any communication or share their repository for feedback, which is critical for a functional feedback loop.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The absence of any documented progress updates, blocker flags, or design discussions indicates a lack of engagement and initiative. The peer did not initiate any communication or share their repository for feedback, which is critical for a functional feedback loop.

### Agent Feedback Relevance

- **Level:** Full Forensic Audit — **Points:** 25

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specifications outlined in the criteria. It provided structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-referencing, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository. The feedback was actionable and relevant, with a synthesized verdict that included criterion scores and remediation suggestions. This indicates a high level of effort and intent to deliver a forensic-quality analysis, even if there may b...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The auditor agent produced a targeted analysis that references actual files and structures within the peer repository. However, while it provided some relevant feedback, it lacked depth in certain areas, such as the absence of a thorough judicial synthesis and detailed remediation steps. The evidence indicates that the audit was grounded but did not fully meet the criteria for a complete forensic audit, thus justifying a score of 3.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specifications, providing structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-references. The feedback was actionable and relevant, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository's structure and content. The synthesis of verdicts with distinct viewpoints from multiple judges further solidified the quality of the output. However, while the audit was comprehensive, there may have been minor areas lacki...

**Remediation:** The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specifications, providing structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-references. The feedback was actionable and relevant, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository's structure and content. The synthesis of verdicts with distinct viewpoints from multiple judges further solidified the quality of the output. However, while the audit was comprehensive, there may have been minor areas lacking in depth regarding the analysis of parallel versus linear structures and reducers, which prevented a perfect score.
