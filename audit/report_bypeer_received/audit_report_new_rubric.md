## Criterion Breakdown

### Development Progress

- **Level:** Complete System — **Points:** 35

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has demonstrated significant effort and intent in their development progress. They have implemented a complete system with atomic commits, a full pipeline that includes detectives, judges, and the Chief Justice, and all required files are present and substantive. The system has been run against a peer repository, producing a real report. While there may be minor areas for improvement, the overall execution reflects a strong understanding of the requirements and a commitment to deliverin...
- **Prosecutor** (score 4): The evidence indicates a complete system with atomic meaningful commits, a full pipeline that includes detectives, judges, and a Chief Justice, as well as all required files present and substantive. The system has been run against a peer repo, producing a real report. This aligns with the criteria for a score of 4, demonstrating a high level of engineering quality and completeness in the deliverable.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of the Chief Justice layer confirms the completeness of the judicial process. However, the score is slightly lower than a perfect 5 due to the la...

**Remediation:** The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of the Chief Justice layer confirms the completeness of the judicial process. However, the score is slightly lower than a perfect 5 due to the lack of multiple atomic commits, which would further demonstrate iterative development and refinement.

### Feedback Implementation

- **Level:** No Exchange — **Points:** 0
- **Excluded from total.**

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): There is no evidence of feedback being exchanged or acted upon, as indicated by the lack of traceable changes in the repository. The absence of any commits or documentation suggests that the peer did not engage with the feedback process at all. Therefore, the score must reflect this lack of interaction.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): There is no evidence of any feedback being exchanged or acted upon. The repository shows no traceable commits or any acknowledgment of feedback, indicating a complete lack of engagement with the review process. This absence of interaction suggests a serious flaw in the implementation of feedback mechanisms.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of any feedback exchange or acknowledgment in the repository. The absence of traceable commits or communication regarding feedback indicates a lack of engagement with the review process. Therefore, the score reflects that no feedback was given or received.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of any feedback exchange or acknowledgment in the repository. The absence of traceable commits or communication regarding feedback indicates a lack of engagement with the review process. Therefore, the score reflects that no feedback was given or received.

### Proactive Communication

- **Level:** Absent — **Points:** 0

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): The evidence indicates a complete absence of proactive communication. There are no records of the peer initiating any updates, sharing progress, or flagging blockers. The lack of engagement and responsiveness suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not contribute to a functional feedback loop. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate as there is no evidence of any communication efforts.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication regarding progress, blockers, or design decisions. The absence of any collected evidence indicates a complete lack of engagement or initiative in maintaining a feedback loop. This suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not contribute to communication efforts, aligning with the failure pattern of being absent.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The lack of any collected evidence indicates that the individual did not engage in regular updates, did not flag blockers, and did not initiate any communication regarding progress or design decisions. This absence of communication suggests a failure to meet the basic expectations for proactive engagement.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The lack of any collected evidence indicates that the individual did not engage in regular updates, did not flag blockers, and did not initiate any communication regarding progress or design decisions. This absence of communication suggests a failure to meet the basic expectations for proactive engagement.

### Agent Feedback Relevance

- **Level:** Full Forensic Audit — **Points:** 25

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specifications outlined. It provided structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-referencing, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository. The presence of multi-perspective judges and a synthesized verdict with criterion scores and remediation further supports the argument for a high score. While there may be minor areas for improvement, the overall effort and intent to deliver actionable ...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The auditor agent produced a targeted analysis that references actual files and structures within the peer repository. However, while it provided some relevant feedback, it lacked depth in certain areas, such as the absence of a thorough judicial synthesis and detailed remediation steps. The evidence indicates that the audit was grounded but did not fully meet the criteria for a complete forensic audit, which would require more comprehensive analysis and distinct viewpoints from multiple judges.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specifications, providing structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-references. The feedback was actionable and relevant, indicating a thorough understanding of the peer repository's structure and content. The audit included distinct perspectives from multiple judges, culminating in a synthesized verdict with appropriate scores and remediation suggestions. However, while the audit was comprehensive, there...

The feedback was actionable and relevant, indicating a thorough understanding of the peer repository's structure and content. The audit included distinct perspectives from multiple judges, culminating in a synthesized verdict with appropriate scores and remediation suggestions. However, while the audit was comprehensive, there may have been minor areas lacking in depth regarding the analysis of parallel versus linear structures or reducers, which prevented a perfect score.

## Remediation Plan

**Development Progress**: The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits and a fully functional pipeline. All required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. The evidence indicates a well-structured approach with clear fan-out and fan-in in the graph, and the presence of the Chief Justice layer confirms the completeness of the judicial process. However, the score is slightly lower than a perfect 5 due to the lack of multiple atomic commits, which would further demonstrate iterative development and refinement.

**Feedback Implementation**: There is no evidence of any feedback exchange or acknowledgment in the repository. The absence of traceable commits or communication regarding feedback indicates a lack of engagement with the review process. Therefore, the score reflects that no feedback was given or received.

**Proactive Communication**: There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The lack of any collected evidence indicates that the individual did not engage in regular updates, did not flag blockers, and did not initiate any communication regarding progress or design decisions. This absence of communication suggests a failure to meet the basic expectations for proactive engagement.
