## Criterion Breakdown

### Development Progress

- **Level:** Complete System — **Points:** 35

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has demonstrated significant effort and intent in their development progress. They have implemented atomic commits, which indicates a thoughtful approach to version control. The pipeline is complete, with all necessary components including detectives, judges, and the Chief Justice functioning as intended. Additionally, all required files are present and substantive, and the system has been successfully run against a peer repository, producing a real report. While there may be minor area...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The evidence indicates that there is a partial implementation of the Week 2 deliverable. While there are atomic commits and a full pipeline structure is present, the evidence suggests that the judicial layer is incomplete or missing, and there is no full audit report provided. The presence of 6 out of 6 required files is a positive aspect, but the overall completeness of the pipeline and the lack of a comprehensive audit report prevent a higher score.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits, a fully functional pipeline, and all required files present. The git history shows meaningful progression, and the system has been run against a peer repository, producing a real report. However, while the evidence suggests a strong implementation, the lack of detailed evidence on the iterative nature of commits and the completeness of the judicial layer prevents a perfect score.

**Remediation:** The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits, a fully functional pipeline, and all required files present. The git history shows meaningful progression, and the system has been run against a peer repository, producing a real report. However, while the evidence suggests a strong implementation, the lack of detailed evidence on the iterative nature of commits and the completeness of the judicial layer prevents a perfect score.

### Feedback Implementation

- **Level:** Selective — **Points:** 12

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The peer has effectively acted on the feedback received, as evidenced by traceable commits that address substantive feedback. There is clear documentation of deferrals and the implementation of agent findings that have led to architectural improvements. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the feedback process and a commitment to improving the project based on that feedback.
- **Prosecutor** (score 2): The evidence indicates that feedback was provided, but there is no substantial evidence of changes made in the repository to address that feedback. The audit report mentions peer feedback files, but it does not confirm that any of the feedback led to traceable commits or documented deferrals. Without clear evidence of action taken on the feedback, the score must reflect that the feedback was largely ignored.
- **TechLead** (score 3): The peer has addressed some feedback, as evidenced by visible changes in the git repository. However, not all substantive feedback was fully integrated, and there are instances of deeper feedback that remain unaddressed without explanation. While there is at least one concrete change stemming from agent findings, the overall response to feedback lacks completeness and thoroughness.

### Proactive Communication

- **Level:** Absent — **Points:** 0

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 1): The evidence indicates a complete absence of proactive communication. There are no records of the peer initiating any updates, sharing progress, or flagging blockers. The lack of engagement and responsiveness suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not contribute to a functional feedback loop. Therefore, a score of 1 is warranted as there is no evidence of any communication efforts.
- **Prosecutor** (score 1): The evidence indicates a complete absence of proactive communication. There are no records of progress updates, blocker flagging, or any engagement in the feedback loop. The lack of evidence suggests that the peer was unreachable and did not initiate any communication, which aligns with the failure pattern of being absent. Therefore, a score of 1 is warranted.
- **TechLead** (score 1): There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The lack of any collected evidence indicates that the individual did not engage in regular updates, did not flag blockers, and did not initiate any communication regarding progress or design decisions. This absence of communication suggests a failure to meet the basic expectations for proactive engagement in the project.

**Remediation:** There is no evidence of proactive communication from the peer. The lack of any collected evidence indicates that the individual did not engage in regular updates, did not flag blockers, and did not initiate any communication regarding progress or design decisions. This absence of communication suggests a failure to meet the basic expectations for proactive engagement in the project.

### Agent Feedback Relevance

- **Level:** Full Forensic Audit — **Points:** 25

**Judge opinions:**
- **Defense** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete audit report that adhered to the specified requirements. It provided structured evidence through git, AST, file analysis, and cross-referencing, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the peer repository. The feedback was actionable and relevant, with a synthesized verdict that included criterion scores and remediation suggestions. This indicates a high level of effort and intent to deliver a forensic-quality analysis, even if there may be minor areas for...
- **Prosecutor** (score 3): The auditor agent produced a targeted analysis with relevant feedback, referencing actual files and structures. However, it lacked depth in certain areas, such as the absence of a thorough judicial synthesis and some missing checks. While the audit was structured and grounded, it did not reach the full forensic audit level due to these gaps.
- **TechLead** (score 4): The auditor agent produced a complete forensic audit report that adhered to the specifications. It provided structured evidence through git analysis, AST, file analysis, and cross-referencing. The feedback was actionable and relevant, with a synthesized verdict that included criterion scores and remediation suggestions. The presence of multi-perspective judges further enhanced the credibility of the findings. However, while the audit was thorough, there may have been minor areas lacking in depth...

The presence of multi-perspective judges further enhanced the credibility of the findings. However, while the audit was thorough, there may have been minor areas lacking in depth regarding the analysis of parallel versus linear structures and reducers, which prevented a perfect score.

## Remediation Plan

**Development Progress**: The implementation demonstrates a complete system with atomic commits, a fully functional pipeline, and all required files present. The git history shows meaningful progression, and the system has been run against a peer repository, producing a real report. However, while the evidence suggests a strong implementation, the lack of detailed evidence on the iterative nature of commits and the completeness of the judicial layer prevents a perfect score.
